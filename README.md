# Heart Rate Zone Analyzer

This project exists for me to play with Bun and try out Bun's unit testing features. It's also a school assignment.

This program takes in .csv files from Garmin Connect and analyzes heart rate zone data. It outputs the total percentage of time spent in each heart rate zone. 7 days of my running data is included in the data directory as an example. Replace the data with your own data to analyze your own heart rate zone data.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```
or 

```bash
bun run start
```
